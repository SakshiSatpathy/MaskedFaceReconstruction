# MaskedFaceReconstruction
### Pipeline:
1. sam_experiment.py: This code allows the user to segment the original images using SAM.
Note: you have to manually update the filepaths within the code.
Running the code will prompt a small GUI to select points to include/exclude in the segmented image.
Left-clicking on a point (shown as a blue dot) will INCLUDE that point, and Right-Clicking (shown as a red dot) will EXCLUDE that point.
